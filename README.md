### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working for the [AdoptOpenJDK](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK) project to provide stable, free Java binaries for all! Right now, I am focusing on improving Adopt's stability and build environments at [openjdk-build](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-build). However, I wish to extend my intial interest in Kotlin so I have been making forays into [openjdk-api-v3](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-api-v3) which heavily imploys this framework.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [ReactJS](https://github.com/M-Davies/aced-arsenal) and [discord.py](https://github.com/M-Davies/oghma) for personal projects.

- :school:  As part of my final year university project, I am developing a [gesture and facial recognition authentication system](https://github.com/M-Davies/eye-of-horus) utilising AWS machine learning and a ReactJS frontend website. Furthermore, various university projects and tasks have been completed by myself (or as part of a team) over the past 3 years, most of which I have [made public](https://github.com/M-Davies/UniversityProjects). Please see these projects for examples of what I have studied so far.
