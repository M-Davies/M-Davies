### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working for the [Adoptium](https://github.com/adoptium) project to provide stable, free Java binaries for all! Right now, I am focusing on improving Adopt's stability and build environments, jenkins services and Kotlin REST API.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [ReactJS](https://github.com/M-Davies/aced-arsenal) and [discord.py](https://github.com/M-Davies/oghma) for personal projects, as well as for my own profile website! In addition, I am currently looking at improving my REST API development knowledge (and income) in Java from an application allowing for the distribution and sorting of Arma 3 classname data.

- :school:  As part of my final year university project, I am developing a [gesture and facial recognition authentication system](https://github.com/M-Davies/eye-of-horus) utilising AWS machine learning and a ReactJS frontend website. Furthermore, various university projects and tasks have been completed by myself (or as part of a team) over the past 3 years, most of which I have [made public](https://github.com/M-Davies/UniversityProjects). Please see these projects for examples of what I have studied so far.
